Fully Open Source Extension to Automize Gladiatus 
this Extension doesn't access any of the data used by the user, this extension only role is to play gladiatus instead of you,
fully automating the process of Expeditio, dungeon, arena, circus Turma, healing, 
attacking the first availble target(I will add an option to chose which target to attack)
quest management(only accepting arena, circus turma and battles) by accepting refreshing 
and finishing quest, refreshing the list of none of the specified types of quests exist, 
auto-training dexterity(I will try to make an option to chose which stat to increase)  
hopefully the next version will have more custumization for the user.
